Fenics-arclength Documentation
============================================

**fenics-arclength** is a Python implementation of the arclength solver built on top of FEniCS. 
The Arc Length Method, sometimes referred to as the Riks Method, is a method used to solve solid mechanics problems with geometric nonlinearity
with complex equilibrium paths. 
The library aims to keep the usage as similiar to `FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org/download/archive/>`_ (version 2019.1.0) to allow
for off-the-shelf implementation and integration with other FEniCS workflows.

Usage

Dependencies
############

This package solely depends on FEniCS 2019.1.0. It is not tested on other packages.
`Instructions to install FEniCS (legacy) can be found here. <https://fenicsproject.org/download/archive/>`_

Package Installation
####################
To use our arc-length solver, download and append our `repository <https://github.com/pprachas/fenics_arclength>`_ to the python path. Common methods to do this are:

* Add directory to ``PYTHONPATH``:

   * On Ubuntu or Mac (Note that you might have to first find your python path in the computer and add it to the bash profile first.):
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      export PYTHONPATH=<path/to/fenics_arclength>:$PYTHONPATH


   * On Windows:

   .. code-block:: bash

      set PYTHONPATH=<path/to/fenics_arclength>;%PYTHONPATH%


* Append directory to path in python script:

.. code-block:: python

   import sys
   sys.path.append('path/to/fenics_arclength')


Theory
--------------------------
The general concepts behind non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) are introduced here for both educational purposes and completeness. In addition, we briefly describe the implementation of both arclength solvers in our package. We also provide an example on modifying the arc-length predictor scheme for geometrically exact beams. The links below contain significant additional detail.

Notebook Examples
----------------------------------
To execute the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, please download the
`repository <https://github.com/pprachas/fenics_arclength>`_ and use the notebooks in the ``examples`` folder. Note that downloading
the notebook directly from ReadTheDocs will not guarantee that the examples will run since the files will be
missing other components (i.e. meshes, other scripts).
